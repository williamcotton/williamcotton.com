      <p>Ultimate Truth is the guiding light. It's worth aiming for. It's worth it to be a good person. It is worth trying to figure out the difference between right and wrong. This is just common sense. If I'm a mean person, and I hurt people, I'm not going to have a peaceful coexistance with the rest of humanity. Call it a mixture of utilitarian and mystical nonsense. I'm nothing other than a summation of my experiences somehow existing in a cohesive form and trying desperately to understand what that means.</p>
      <p>Lacanians call it <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real'>The Real</a>, Buddhists call it <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine'>Śūnyatā</a>, and Freemasons call it the <a href='http://www.masonicdictionary.com/truth.html'>Absolute Truth of the Great Architect</a>. All of these and many other philosophical, mystical, religious and spritual organizations are some sort of positive reflection on Ultimate Truth. Whatever the hell that means.</p>
      <p>I'm not particularly interested in spending much time pondering the meaning of Ultimate Truth in a direct manner. I'd rather approach the subject by writing a song about trains or doing the dishes.</p>
      <p>Like Icarus, if you fly too close to the sun, your man-made wings of wax will melt and leave you plummeting to your doom.</p>
